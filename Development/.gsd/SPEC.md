To polish the existing Teravolta web application, stabilizing user flows, connecting disjointed sections, and resolving technical errors to ensure a seamless experience for Customers, Technicians, and Administrators.

## Goals
1.  **Stabilize User Flows:** Identify and fix logic errors in core workflows (Onboarding, Quoting, Service Requests).

-   **Admins:** Overseeing users, requests, and system status.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Technician onboarding flow completes without redirection errors.
- [ ] Customer service request flow connects correctly to Admin dashboard.
- [ ] "Countless errors" in flow logic are identified and resolved.
- [ ] Navigation between portal sections is intuitive and unbroken.
