## Lessons Learned
- **Hybrid Verification**: Combining static code analysis with active browser testing proved essential for diagnosing "Signal Aborted" errors in complex forms.
- **Workflow documentation**: Explicitly documenting logic splits (e.g., Quote Service types) prevents regression.
- **Automation Limits**: High-frequency browser automation can hit rate limits; manual/code verification fallback is necessary.
